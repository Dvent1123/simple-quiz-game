Simple Quiz Game using Javascript

## Usage
This project is a simple quiz game using javascript, css, and html. You can run it by cloning the repo then run the index.html file using an extension like Live Server. The game itself will tell you if you got a question correct or incorrect using an array of objects that contain the questions, answers, and fake answers as well. There is only two questions and answer objects currently but feel free to add your own.
